# Personal Portfolio Site

#### Bradley Stegbauer

This site was created to act as my personal portfolio site, or at least, a first edition of it. I used Sass, Javascript and HTML to create it. For the CSS, I minified it to improve load time for my site.

For the Sass, I used SCSS and split the styling code into each section of the page having its own SCSS stylesheet. I used a 'helpers' folder to hold code such as Sass variables, and Keyframe animations. I imported each individual SCSS into the main 'style.scss' page, and then converted the SCSS into the CSS stylesheet 'style.css'.

For the Javascript, I used an object to hold the properties and the methods related to the portfolio item popup. For other miscellaneous functions and variables, and the popup object, I used Javascript ES6 standards for my syntax.

The icons I used for this site were from Flaticon. I also used assets from Font Awesome's free materials, including, the Github logo, the LinkedIn logo, and the 'X' on my popup screen.

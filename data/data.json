The project entailed using JSON information and having data transfer and communicate between three different React components, with the main component handling all communication. The basic functionality is this, the user can submit their order by selecting one of three different items on the menu, the barista component will respond by stating the price, and sending info to the machine component. The machine component will then use the information, state it is brewing, and display a loading bar. Once completed, the machine will tell the barista it is finished, and the barista will then display a final message.",
